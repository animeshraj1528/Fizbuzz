Ahoy Mates !

FizzBuzz is a popular Python puzzle which was a rememberable stuff which many of the DEVs practiced and experienced in their Dev carrer.

In this tutorial I have printed 'Fizz in front' of the numbers which're divisible by 3 and 
'Buzz in front' the numbers divisible by 5 and 'FizzBuzz in front'
of the numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.

I have put the 'in front of' phrase in commas b'coz many peoples were confused in it....You can change it to instead by just editing some words in the 'fizzbuzz.py' file.

Read the 'fizzbuzz.py' file carefully and understand the puzzle.

Boooooom! Have a nice DEV Journey! ^_^
